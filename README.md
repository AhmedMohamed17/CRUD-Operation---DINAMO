# React + TypeScriptCRUD-Operation---DINAMO Application

This project is a simple web application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It demonstrates fetching, displaying, adding, editing, and deleting posts using the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and utilizes **Ant Design** for the UI.

---

## **Features**
1. **Fetch and Display Data**  
   Posts are fetched from `/posts` endpoint and displayed in a table.
2. **Add New Post**  
   Users can add new posts with a form (fields: Title and Body).
3. **Edit Existing Post**  
   Each post can be updated through a pre-filled form.
4. **Delete Post**  
   Users can delete posts directly from the table.
5. **Error Handling**  
   API errors are handled gracefully using notifications.
6. **Loader**  
   A loader displays during data fetching for a better user experience.

## **How to Run the Application**

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedMohamed17/CRUD-Operation---DINAMO.git
cd CRUD-Operation---DINAMO
```
### 2.  Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
### 3.  Start the Development Server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## **Assumptions Made**

1- The JSONPlaceholder API is stable and accessible.
2- Simulated POST, PUT, and DELETE requests return expected results without persisting data.

## **Challenges Faced**

1- Managing API errors gracefully for a simulated backend.
2- Adding a loader while ensuring a smooth user experience.

## **Time Spent**

Approximate time spent on this assignment: 8-10 hours
